# Minivim

A super simple Neovim configuration with the absolute bare-minimum.
<br>
Great for people who prefer a clean "IDE" with no visual clutter (like me).

## Features

[included]

- Gruvbox theme (default)
- Fuzzy finder (Space + FF, normal mode)
- Auto brackets and indentation
- Hlchunk plugin for extra eye-candy
- Vim-startuptime for diagnostics and performance view ('StartupTime' command)
- Fancy lualine :)

- LSP, language support is limited
- Autocompletions
- File explorer
- Buffer line

## Installation

Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory (usually ~/.config/nvim):

You may also want to install a Nerd Font and Ripgrep for full functionallity.
